> 1. Code Quality

>    * Is all of your code valid?

> ❌ All of your HTML files and the primary CSS file contain validation errors.

> * Is your site visually pleasing?
> 
> Overall the site has a consistent look/feel. The homepage is your strongest page. There's inconsistent spacing on all of your pages - the size of the content boxes changes from page to page, the padding within those boxes also should be consistent and ample. Why are the boxes on the portfolio page so much more narrow when compared to the about page? This in turn makes the images in the container smaller, with a lot of unused space on the sides.
> 
> * Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
> 
> The black text on the dark gray background (resume page as an example) fails a [contrast test](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=000000&bcolor=62737F).

> ## Notes
> Your repository has not been updated in a month, but your live files were updated on 12/14, which means your repo hasn't been updated with your latest code.
> 
> Overall it's a good start, plagued by common issues for a first time developer. I think you have good potential and I'm looking forward to seeing what you can come up with next term.
