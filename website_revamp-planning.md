# "Website Revamp" Project Planning

### Assignment Description
The final project is a fully functioning, fluid, responsive website, built with HTML and CSS. JavaScript enhancements are okay, as long as they are all functioning properly and used as progressive enhancement. The primary focus should be HTML structure and CSS.

### What am I doing?
For my project, I'm redesigning my website (jermestes.com) that was started back in September during IDM221. The end-result 

### What's wrong with original site
The site I turned in last term was way below my expectations and I know I'm capable of much better. The original site and comments from the grading of it can be found in the "original_project" folder. Besides what's said in there, here's my evaluation of what went wrong:
* I never established an identity for the site. I had a general idea of what I thought I wanted, but I didn't know how to make something I wanted or something I made wasn't looking right, I started doing something completely different on the fly. It led to a lot of little problems and almost all my site being done in the last 48 hours before the deadline. 

### To-Do List
1. Create style tile (deciding on general color scheme)
2. Create the site navigation bar
3. Create official wireframes for every page of site in desktop, mobile, and tablet-sized view. (deciding on a legitimate layout)
